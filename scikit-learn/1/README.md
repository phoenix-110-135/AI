# 🌳 Decision Tree Classifier for Dataset Analysis

Welcome to the **Decision Tree Classifier** project! 🚀 This project utilizes the `scikit-learn` library to analyze datasets and predict outcomes based on input features. It also helps you identify if your model is experiencing overfitting or underfitting. 


## 🔧 Installation

To get started, make sure you have Python installed on your machine. Then, install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn pandas
```

## 🏁 Usage

1. **Prepare your dataset**: Place your dataset in a CSV file named `dataset.csv`. The first three columns should contain the features, and the fourth column should contain the target variable.
2. **Run the script**: Execute the following command:

```bash
python decision_tree_classifier.py
```

3. **Check the results**: The script will output the training and testing accuracy, allowing you to assess the model's performance! 📊

## 📊 Dataset

Your dataset should be in CSV format with the following structure:

```
feature1, feature2, feature3, target
value1, value2, value3, class1
value1, value2, value3, class2
...
```

## 📈 Evaluation

The model evaluates its performance by calculating the accuracy on both the training and testing datasets. Here’s how to interpret the results:

- **Overfitting**: High training accuracy but low testing accuracy. 🚨
- **Underfitting**: Low accuracy on both training and testing datasets. 🥺
